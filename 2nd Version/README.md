# Sondata-Studios
A 'Team Cars' effort

This is the the group repository for for CM3130: INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM PROJECT

Our Project is made “in collaboration” with Sondata Studios, who specified the requirements of this project.
This project is dedicated to both the people at Sondata Studios, who wanted a way to bring sound generated patterns and various handicrafts more easily to more people, and the people who find an interest in creating patterns through sound, and want a way to easily reach out to makers on the subject.
In order to complete this project, we intend to individually complete different parts of the website, and work as a team to seamlessly bring it all together. We will keep in close contact with Sondata Studios to make sure that the project best fits their requirements and needs.
We will create a webpage that will allow users to upload a sound file, edit their sound using filters, make a spectrogram out of it, save a picture of the spectrogram if they wish, and send it to a maker that works with Sondata studios to request a handicraft based on the pattern. The website would also show a preview of what said handicraft might look like.
