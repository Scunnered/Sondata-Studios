# Sondata-Studios

This is the the group repository for for CM3130: INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM PROJECT

Our project is with Sondata Studios, who specified the requirements of this project. The goal of our project was to create an audio visualiser embedded in a newly created webpage for Sondata. 
Sondata explores contemporary art and design practice through a distributed and disruptive manner of collaboration. It uses a developing and robust digital/analogue multi-sensory process that promotes alternative environmental attunement to place.
The audio visualiser is a program that displays sound generated patterns and various handicrafts more swiftly to a broader audience. Sondata requires this program to reach more users who have a general interest in crafting designs through audio.
By uploading an audio file, the program would analyse the file and display a spectrogram in real-time. The spectrogram was to be editable and downloadable, allowing the user to pick the part they like the most, which can then be sent to Sontada Studio and made into a real-world accessory.
The project involved massive research and experimentation with audio (mostly creating spectrograms in real-time), image manipulation and uploading the spectrogram using databases (MongoDB). Our Team Cars managed to overcome the majority of encountered issues, implementing most of the requested features - to the best of our abilities.
